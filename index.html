    <p>I am an experienced End-Point Assessor and Moderator with a strong background in ICT, networking, data analysis, and project & programme management. With a proven record of supporting learners through high-stakes assessments, I combine technical expertise with a clear understanding of apprenticeship standards and quality assurance frameworks.</p>
    <p>Drawing on years of experience in both industry and education, I bring a structured yet pragmatic approach to blueprinting, assessment design, and standard verification. My focus is on maintaining integrity, consistency, and fairness across assessment outcomes, while promoting excellence in digital and technical education across the UK.</p>
